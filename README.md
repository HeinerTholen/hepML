# hepML

A package for machine learning studies with HEP

Start by turning your root trees into numpy arrays!

To do this install root_numpy... http://scikit-hep.org/root_numpy/start.html

For convenience, if you have access to cvmfs just use:

```source lcgenv.sh```

See a basic workflow in run.py. Test it with:

```python run.py```
