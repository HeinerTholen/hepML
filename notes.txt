TODO:

- generalise the array unpacking in the pandas plotter (beyond the 1d hist)
- Factorise run.py into useful functions when they become clear

Possibilities:

- move to root_pandas instead of root_numpy 

NOTE:

- For now NaNs are set to 0 for compatibility with ML libraries, may want to
  revise this later
